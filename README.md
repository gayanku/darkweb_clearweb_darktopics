**preprecessing invloved** : filtering out all posts that could not create valid timestamps after attempting to recover much posts as possible. For example, we recovered "At 10.30" and "9.45 pm" by removing the offending text snippets "At" and "pm". We dropped "Yesterday", "Today" posts as we do not have information of the actual time they were scraped, or the time zone. We also dropped other text not directly convertible as a valid time. In cases where the date was present with no time value, we still attempted to reconstruct the datetime as date:00:00:00. In the obtained data times, we still found incorrect values such as a date "2061-06-01 00:00:00" for Silkroad 1. For this reason, we filtered the datetimes for the active period of each darkweb forum, based on the pragmatic assumption that posts can only originate within the lifespan of the forum.
